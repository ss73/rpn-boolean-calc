# RPN Boolean calculator

This is a sample JavaScript application that demonstrates the use of reverse polish notaton (RPN) by providing a boolean calculator. Values are pushed to the stack. Operators pops the stack and push the result back on the stack.

Example:
true, false, or, true, and

is evaluated as:
(true or false) and true (equals true).

One benefit of RPN is that there is no need for parenthesises.
